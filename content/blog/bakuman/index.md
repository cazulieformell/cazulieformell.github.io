[Bakuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuman) is one of my favorite anime, and I have always wanted to write about it. Someday, I hope I will write this post.

### Strengths

- Display of passion and dedication
- Showcasing different versions of artists - some who create art by strategizing to create something new, and others who have art flowing through them.
- Insight into how manga is created
- Awesome opening song (blue bird)
- Interesting balance of lovers who are also dedicated to their career goals

## Weaknesses

- Romanticism of the death by overworking
- Representation and place of female characters is extremely backward, to say the least. The protagonist's father said something like "A woman cannot understand the goals of a man." when talking about the protagonist's career goals. That was really bad...
