**Work in progress!**
[Bakuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuman) is one of my favorite anime, and I have always wanted to write about it. Someday, I hope I will write this post.

### Strengths

- Display of passion and dedication
- Significance of healthy competition, rivalry and good mentorship
- Showcasing different versions of artists - some who create art by strategizing to create something new, and others who have art flowing through them.
- Insight into how manga is created
- Awesome opening song (blue bird)
- Interesting balance of lovers who are also dedicated to their career goals

## Weaknesses

- Romanticism of the death by overworking
- Representation and place of female characters is extremely backward, to say the least. The protagonist's father said something like "A woman cannot understand the goals of a man." when talking about the protagonist's career goals. That was really bad... Sadly, many anime suffer from it. Characters can be noble, but still glorified perverts (e.g., Jiraiya from Naruto). Interestingly, Gintama, where none of the characters try to be noble, seems to be an anime where I see women being respectfully respected.
