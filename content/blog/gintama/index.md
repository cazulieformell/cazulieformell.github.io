To me, Gintama is a story of a very creative author who loves anime. He loves comedy, but also Shonen (serious) anime to their deepest and manages to mix them both to perfection. One of the things that set the anime apart is the range of the author to have characters hilariously deal with ridiculous day to day of life (insomnia, sweet tooth, sugar addiction and many too-impolite-for-dinnner table circumstances) but also talk about the typically serious things that define a serious Shonen show (end of the samurai era, protecting your friends and loved ones, and failing to protect your friends loved ones)
