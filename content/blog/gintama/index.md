**Work in progress!**

To me, Gintama is a story of a very creative author who loves anime. He loves comedy, but also Shonen (serious) anime and manages to mix them both to perfection. He knows a lot - Japanese (and American) culture, history, trends. One of the things that set the anime apart is the range of the author to have characters hilariously deal with ridiculous day to day of life (insomnia, sweet tooth, sugar addiction and many too-impolite-for-dinnner table circumstances) but also talk about the typically serious things that define a serious Shonen show (end of the samurai era, protecting your friends and loved ones, and failing to protect your friends loved ones)

So, movie clips cannot be added. Thus, dialogues need to be added in different ways. Maybe crunchyroll links with time stamps mentioned?

- Serious dialogues - kawarani! The fight where the invaders mock Earth for having women and children fighting in the war, and Kyubei responds by saying "The consequences of war are for women and children. Surely, your exploits will not stop just because a few of us (women) are standing in your way."
- Hilarious events - Hasegawa suicide
- Seriousness in hilarious start (Slice of life) - Madao bloom
- Grossly hilarious events - Shogun negotiation in the last arc.
