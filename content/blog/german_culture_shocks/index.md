**Work in progress**

1. So many pets
2. No ceiling fans
3. Good bakeries and bread
4. The fun and fast checkouts at the super markets
5. Rather expensive public toilets
6. So. Much. Post.
7. Huge buses. How is that safe? (Statistics reveal that it is, so I am not questioning anything)
8. No security personnel in the buildings. It is strange to me how very big buildings are just defended by a couple of locks and keys. There is no one guarding anything at all times!


So far, I have had a great experience with Germany and its people. A "why I love Germany" article (Add link!) is also in progress.

The initial setup was a little hard because I didn't have all the information (I also have an article about my experience in progress (Add link!)), but things became pretty simple after that. I was told that Germans are cold and distant, I do not get that feeling at all.
