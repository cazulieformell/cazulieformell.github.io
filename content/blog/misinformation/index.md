**Work in progress**

I do not think that sharing conspiracy theories is usually the way to go. Unless you really have some hard evidence that convinces you, don't share it.

1. How to make sure it convinces you?
2. Wasn't "COVID-19 is a lab leak" once a ridiculous conspiracy theory, and is now lesser so?
