**Work in progress**

1. I can bike! Maybe someone from Netherlands will say it is not that great, but I find my city to be very biker friendly!
2. Good canned food and stuff that makes healthy cooking fast and easy (okay, my priorities are not entirely)
3. Quiet place
4. Pretty places so close.
5. Public transport works! (It doesn't work great, but it does work enough for me to not need a car)
6. People are helpful.
