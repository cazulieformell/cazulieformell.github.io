**Work in progress**
A few years ago, I would have found myself crazy to have needed this discussion. But, it is needed. Some of the people that I really look up to, believe that climate change is a scam by big institutions to make big money.

 I will argue for the reality of climate change, and the reality of the fact that climate change is human induced, without any evidence.

1. The scientific method of study works.
2. Governments of Europe, Canada and the US will be elated if climate change wasn't real. There are plenty of groups fighting against climate change. If they could just produce some actual evidence, the countries will happily stop the huge spending they are already doing.
3. We learnt about it in school!
