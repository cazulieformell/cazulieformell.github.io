**Work in progress**

We love computer games, not because they do not require work, but because the goals, the path and the rewards are very clear. This is also true for language learning today. It will be a slow process, but you can definitely gamify it enough to make it a fun hobby. It does depend on the language you are learning though. So far, I have tried it with Japanese, Korean and German. I didn't make it very far with either of these languages but I knew I could enjoy learning them.

1. Duolingo (Yes, please don't hate me!)
2. Anki (Fun as long as you don't overload it)
