Kazuri Foumu (shortening Casually Formal) is my internet name. I do not think it is a typical name anywhere, but it is supposed to *feel Japanese*. In Japanese, nicknames are often built by concatenating first and last names (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name#Nicknames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name#Nicknames)). Hence, the website is called kazomu.
